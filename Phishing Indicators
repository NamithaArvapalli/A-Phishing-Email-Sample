✅ Common Phishing Indicators
1. Suspicious Sender Address
Email appears to be from a known entity but uses a slightly altered or unusual domain (e.g., micr0soft.com, account-microsoft.xyz).
Display name might say “Microsoft Support” but the actual email is something odd.

2. Generic Greeting
Phrases like “Dear User” or “Dear Customer” instead of using your real name.
Legitimate organizations usually personalize emails.

3. Urgent or Threatening Language
Examples:
“Your account will be suspended!”
“Unauthorized login detected!”
This creates panic and pushes you to act without thinking.

4. Unexpected Attachments
Phishing emails may include PDFs, Word files, or ZIP archives with malware.
Never open attachments unless you're sure they’re safe.

5. Suspicious or Mismatched Links
The displayed text says one thing (e.g., https://microsoft.com), but hovering reveals a different, malicious domain.
Use hover-to-preview or right-click and copy to inspect.

6. Spelling and Grammar Errors
Phishing emails often contain awkward grammar, typos, or inconsistent formatting.

7. Requests for Sensitive Information
Legitimate companies never ask for passwords, OTPs, or credit card numbers via email.
Phrases like “verify your identity” or “confirm your login details” are red flags.

8. Too Good to Be True Offers
Examples:
“You’ve won a prize!”
“Get free money / gift cards”
These play on curiosity and greed.

9. Fake or Missing Branding
Logos may look off, blurry, or missing entirely.
The email design may not match the company’s typical communication style.

10. Unusual Timing or Context
Receiving an email about a service you don’t use or at a strange time (e.g., midnight).
Email claims you’ve made a purchase or login you don’t recognize.


Bonus: Technical Indicators in Email Headers
(For advanced users)
Mismatched “From” and “Reply-To” addresses.
IP addresses that don’t match the sender’s actual domain.
Failing SPF, DKIM, or DMARC checks.
